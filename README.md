# Countdown

> A minimal countdown timer.

I made this to get familiar with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
It is hosted at [elimerl.github.io/countdown/](https://elimerl.github.io/countdown/)

## Usage

Click the text that says `Countdown ends` - you can edit it!
To change the date, use the datetime picker.
To share the countdown, press `Copy Permalink`.
